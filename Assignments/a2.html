            <h1>How do Video Games Affect Kids and Adolescents?  </h1>
            <img src="2.jpg" alt="Cover Image">
            <p>The audience for this website is for parents, kids, and adolescents who would like to know the pros and cons about video games. It can be concerned parents before buying video games or gamers (especially the younger ones) to understand potential risks and benefits of video games. This approach will be effective for this specific audience because it will provide correct information to parents and potential gamers, and young gamers. There is plenty of misinformation about video games, especially about violent video games so the goal of this website is to let people know the pros and cons; it is not an attempt to persuade people to either love or hate violent video games. It is purely to learn more information on violent video games.</p>
            <p>Video games, like many other things in this world has its pros and cons. If you are a concerned parent, kid or adolescent and want to learn more about what how video games may affect a person, this is an excellent start as all the information is from reliable peer-reviewed journals. There has been debates for years and it continues as to if whether or not video games are good or bad for kid’s and adolescent’s behaviour. It is hard to determine the reliability and validity of the methods conducted from studies as there are so many contradictory studies. What we can say for sure though is that there is some good and some bad components to video games. The media tends to make video games seem negative more often than good. The reality is that there are many different types of video games, some may have more pros than cons and vise versa but it depends on some factors such as what is the content, what is the age of the person playing, how long are they playing for, is there other activities that this person does on spare time? The purpose of this website is not so say that video games are good or bad, it is to give insight to parents, kids and adolescents on the pros and cons of video games. For instance, did you that in the game, World of Warcraft, players “are confronted with moral dilemmas which demand decision-making, social obligations and responsibilities, perspective taking and empathy, perseverance and delayed gratification” (Khoo, 2012).  Even though within that game there is violence and deaths, it does have many positives, it even helps develop friendships since you can meet other people online. To see if a video game may be right for you or your child, it is important to do some research behind it to see if it will be appropriate; don’t judge a video game by its cover!  </p>
